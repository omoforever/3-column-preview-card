# 3-Column Preview Card Component

A responsive and visually balanced component built as part of a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. This project presents a 3-column layout highlighting different vehicle categories, each with its own icon, title, description, and action button.

## Overview

This component includes:

- Three equally sized content cards laid out side-by-side on desktop
- Stacked layout on smaller screens for mobile responsiveness
- Distinct hover states on call-to-action buttons
- Clean, semantic HTML structure and responsive CSS layout

The goal was to focus on **responsive design**, **consistent visual hierarchy**, and **hover interaction styling** using basic front-end tools.

## Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- [Optional: add Flexbox, Grid, or any tools used]

## What I Learned

- Structuring components using semantic HTML for readability and accessibility  
- Building a flexible, responsive 3-column layout using modern CSS techniques  
- Applying consistent padding, margin, and typography for clean visual presentation
